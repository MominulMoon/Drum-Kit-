# 🥁 Drum Kit Project

Welcome to the **Drum Kit**! This is a simple, interactive web application that allows you to play the drums using your mouse or your keyboard. It’s a great example of how **DOM manipulation** and **Event Listeners** work in JavaScript.

## ✨ Features

* **Dual Input:** Play by clicking the buttons on the screen or by pressing specific keys on your keyboard.
* **High Quality Sound:** Features 7 unique drum sounds (Toms, Snare, Crash, and Kick).
* **Visual Animations:** Buttons light up and animate when pressed to give a "physical" feel.
* **Pure JavaScript:** No heavy frameworks—built with 100% Vanilla JS.
